# Team MagicCube

## What was the goal of your Web Application?

Let users make pictures with a 7x7, six-sided Rubik's Cube.  

## What new JavaScript skill did you learn? What resources did you use to learn it?

Using W3Schools, GeeksForGeeks, and Stackoverflow, learned how to write more advanced statements in JavaScript.  

- Toggling content

- Changing `<td>` one at a time

- Random colors

- Calling element methods

## How was "Magic" incorporated into the project?

Every time users hit a button, the Rubik's cube "magically" switches to a different picture.
