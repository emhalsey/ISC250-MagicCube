# Team MagicCube

## What was the goal of your Web Application?

Let users make pictures with a 7x7, six-sided Rubik's Cube.  

## What new JavaScript skill did you learn? What resources did you use to learn it?

We learned how to animate images using W3Schools and more complex button functions, also using W3Schools.  

## How was "Magic" incorporated into the project?

Every time users hit a button, the cube "magically" rotates to a different picture.
