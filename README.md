# Team MagicCube

## What was the goal of your Web Application?

Let users make pictures with a 7x7, six-sided Rubix Cube.  

## What new JavaScript skill did you learn? What resources did you use to learn it?



  

## How was "Magic" incorporated into the project?

Every time users hit a button, the cube "magically" rotates to a different picture.
